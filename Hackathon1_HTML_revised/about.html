                <h2>Old World vs New World wines: what you need to know</h2>
                    <p>
                        6th April 2020  1comments on Old World vs New World wines: what you need to know
                        Here’s a question for you: are you better matched to Old World or New World wines?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        All over the world, there are different vineyards which incorporate various winemaking practices and growing techniques. The concept of Old and New World wines is something that is commonly mistaken. Old World wines come from the original wine growing regions within Europe. Whereas New World wines come from everywhere else like Australia, Argentina, the USA, the list goes on. 
                        <br>
                        It’s common knowledge that weather conditions influence a wine’s taste.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        But, what is the real difference between a Chardonnay from France and one from Australia?
                        <br> Passionate wine lovers know that whether you are looking for a bottle for a special gift or a bottle for the dinner table, both New World wine and Old World wines offer a unique experience.
                        <br> The question is, which one do you want to share your evening with?
                    </p>

                <h2>Meet the Old World</h2>
                    <p>
                        Picture a dashing, smartly dressed man at the bar of a private members club, this is Old World wine. He's refined, sophisticated, his very presence exudes elegance. The wines from the Old World are usually more restrained, they contain a lower percentage of alcohol and have a lighter body. This is generally considered to be because countries that come under the Old World wine range have to follow stringent guidelines, which can heavily restrict them in the winemaking process.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One thing that draws people towards Old World wines, is their long-dated legacy dating. In every sip, you can taste the romantic tradition of these wines and their classic, vintage style. The same wines were drunk by Hemingway, Picasso, Shakespeare, Homer and others.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ultimately, they present a certain approach to nostalgia that many people love. It is always nice to know, that the wine in our glass has been made in the same way and in the same place for centuries.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Think again of the smart man at the bar. Is he who you'd like to spend your evening with? Or are you looking for someone a bit more unpredictable?
                    </p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <h2>Meet the New World</h2>
                    <p>
                        New World wine is Old World's younger sister: she's lively, light and bubbly. Gone is the finely tailored suit, New World wine is ready to mix things up. Compared to the Old World, the countries that fall into the New World variety have much more control when it comes down to how their wine is going to taste.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The rules and regulations in the Old World countries could be said to extremely affect their taste and style, but winemakers in the New World symbolise an innovative spirit.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This can be expected when we reflect on the history of immigration; the people who wanted to seek freedom and live ‘the American dream’ brought new ideas to the table. As a result, there is an increased level of experimentation leading to a selection of more modern day wines compared to the Old World, which has more of a traditional approach.
                    </p>
                    <p class="quotes">
                        New World wine is all about exploring new and innovative flavour combinations. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The differecne simply put; Old World wines are described to have a much lighter taste, higher acidity and a less fruity palate. Whereas, New World wines taste much riper, have a lower concentration of acidity and taste fruitier.

                <h2>The Climate</h2>
                    <p>
                        Geographical differences mean a difference in climate, resulting in a difference in taste, style and form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the New World, the climate is often much warmer which as a result, creates a riper, full-bodied wine. Whereas, the old world climate results in the wines containing more earthy components.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For example, the “2009 Chateau Siaurac” originating from France was quoted to be “truffle” and “chunky” which implies that the wine is earthy. Whereas, the “2011 Brancott Sauvignon Blanc” was quoted to contain “bright passion fruit flavours” which fits well under the characteristics of the conventional New World wine.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Old world wines come from countries or regions where winemaking first originated, from France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Turkey, Georgia and Moldova. To give you an idea, we recommend trying Old World wines such as; a French Chardonnay, a Chianti from Italy, or a Spanish Rioja.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        New age wines come from countries who imported winemaking during and after the age of exploration, 15th - 18th Century; they come from United States, Australia, South Africa, Chile, Argentina, New Zealand, China, India and Japan. Some options for new world wines to consider include; a Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon, a New Zealand Pinot Gris, or a White Zinfandel from the US.
